# image-description

Final project for CS578 at Purdue University. 

The goal is to test the kernelized derivation of the Frustratingly Easy domain adaptation framework proposed by [Hal Daume](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/docs/daume07easyadapt.pdf) on the image description ranking task proposed by [Hodosh et. al](http://www.jair.org/media/3994/live-3994-7274-jair.pdf)

The adaptation was set taking clip-art images from the Microsoft Abstract Scene dataset as the source domain and Flickr30k, a repository of real images, as the target domain.
